# Vitaki fork notes

This is ywnico's fork of [aa's Vitaki](https://git.catvibers.me/aa/chiaki) with the following updates:
1. Implemented audio
2. Added control mappings for L2, R2, L3, R3, and touchpad (trapezoid button), following the official ps4 remote play maps in `vs0:app/NPXS10013/keymap/`
    - Note: `Select` + `Start` sends the PS (home) button
3. Fixed instant deconnection bug
4. Disabled `vblank_wait` and set fps to 30 to reduce lag.
    - NOTE: the fps in the config file (`chiaki.toml`) will be ignored
5. Made debug logs visible, added tooltips on some buttons
6. Merged in updates from chiaki4deck (improved some connection issues)
7. Included [ghost's LiveArea icon fixes](https://git.catvibers.me/aa/chiaki/pulls/13)
8. Various bug and crash fixes

## Instructions
### Local connection
1. Connect PS Vita and PS5 (or PS4) to the same local WiFi network.
2. Log in to the same PSN account on both the PS5 and the Vita.
3. Open Vitaki on PS Vita.
4. Check settings (gear icon) to ensure your encoded PSN ID is there (if it's not automatically populated, or you accidentally deleted it, there are a number of websites that will tell you your encoded PSN ID given your account username. Or, you can quit Vitaki, delete the Vitaki settings directory, `ux0:data/vita-chiaki`, and let Vitaki auto-detect it again).
5. The console should be automatically detected and appear as an icon.
6. Select the console and Vitaki should ask for a registration code. On the PS5, navigate to `Settings > System > Remote Play` and select `Pair Device`. An 8-digit numeric code should appear; enter this into Vitaki and hit circle.
7. Select the console again in Vitaki. It should now connect (and in the future, will not ask for the device pairing code).

There are a number of known bugs. Most notably, if there are multiple consoles on the network, connection will fail.

### Remote connection
UDP holepunching is not supported. Instead, a remote connection requires a static IP and port forwarding.

1. Register your console on your local network following the above instructions.
2. Follow the "manual remote connection" section in [these instructions](https://streetpea.github.io/chiaki-ng/setup/remoteconnection/#manual-remote-connection) to set up a static IP and port forwarding on your network.
3. TODO


# Chiaki4deck

## [chiaki4deck](https://streetpea.github.io/chiaki4deck/)

![chiaki4deck Logo](gui/chiaki4deck.png)

An open source project looking to help users of the Steam Deck get the most out of Chiaki. [Click here to see the accompanying site for documentation, updates and more](https://streetpea.github.io/chiaki4deck/). 

**Disclaimer:** This project is not endorsed or certified by Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC.

Chiaki is a Free and Open Source Software Client for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 Remote Play
for Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Android, macOS, Windows, Nintendo Switch and potentially even more platforms.

## Project Status

As all relevant features are implemented, this project is considered to be finished and in maintenance mode only.
No major updates are planned and contributions are only accepted in special cases.

## Installing

You can either download a pre-built release or build Chiaki from source.

### Downloading a Release

Builds are provided for Linux, Android, macOS, Nintendo Switch and Windows.

You can download them [here](https://git.sr.ht/~thestr4ng3r/chiaki/refs).

* **Linux**: The provided file is an [AppImage](https://appimage.org/). Simply make it executable (`chmod +x <file>.AppImage`) and run it.
* **Android**: Install from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.metallic.chiaki/) or download the APK from Sourcehut.
* **macOS**: Drag the application from the `.dmg` into your Applications folder.
* **Windows**: Extract the `.zip` file and execute `chiaki.exe`.
* **Switch**: Download the `.nro` file and copy it into the `switch/` directory on your SD card.

### Building from Source

Dependencies are CMake, Qt 5 with QtMultimedia, QtOpenGL and QtSvg, FFMPEG (libavcodec with H264 is enough), libopus, OpenSSL 1.1, SDL 2,
protoc and the protobuf Python library (only used during compilation for Nanopb). Then, Chiaki builds just like any other CMake project:
```
git submodule update --init
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

For more detailed platform-specific instructions, see [doc/platform-build.md](doc/platform-build.md) or [switch/](./switch/README.md) for Nintendo Switch.

## Usage

If your Console is on your local network, is turned on or in standby mode and does not have Discovery explicitly disabled, Chiaki should find it.
Otherwise, you can add it manually.
To do so, click the "+" icon in the top right, and enter your Console's IP address.

You will then need to register your Console with Chiaki. You will need two more pieces of information to do this.

### Obtaining your PSN AccountID

Starting with PS4 7.0, it is necessary to use a so-called "AccountID" as opposed to the "Online-ID" for registration (streaming itself did not change).
This ID seems to be a unique identifier for a PSN Account and it can be obtained from the PSN after logging in using OAuth.
A Python 3 script which does this is provided in [scripts/psn-account-id.py](scripts/psn-account-id.py).
Simply run it in a terminal and follow the instructions. Once you know your ID, write it down. You will likely never have to do this process again.

### Obtaining a Registration PIN

To register a Console with a PIN, it must be put into registration mode. To do this on a PS4, simply go to:
Settings -> Remote Play -> Add Device, or on a PS5: Settings -> System -> Remote Play -> Link Device.

You can now double-click your Console in Chiaki's main window to start Remote Play.
